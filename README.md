[11/9, 11:18 PM] 爪乇Єƚ: Here are some key takeaways from the web search results:

1. A **key takeaway slide** summarizes the important points covered in the presentation. They are usually the key insights, implications, recommendations, or next steps¹.
2. To figure out what you should include in your key takeaways, you should ask yourself the following questions: What will my audience care about? What are the implications or “so whats” of the work that I have done? What points have the biggest “bang for your buck”?¹
3. There’s a long running rumor that McKinsey, the world’s most prestigious strategy consulting firm, tells their staff to always follow “The Rule of 3”. The Rule of 3 states that you should always present key points, reasons, recommendations, or next steps in threes¹.
4. Based on my experience as a management consultant who has spent thousand of hours writing slide decks, my recommendation would be to limit yourself to between 3-6 key points¹.

[11/9, 11:18 PM] 爪乇Єƚ: Some possible takeaways from the current web page context are:

- The web page is about **ASP.NET Web Validation Controls**, which are used to **validate user input** on web forms.
- The web page explains the **advantages** of using validation controls, such as **quick and precise feedback**, **usability and likeability**, and **security**.
- The web page compares **client-side** and **server-side** validations, and their **pros and cons**.
- The web page introduces **seven types** of validation controls, and their **properties** and **functions**. They are: **Required
[11/9, 11:18 PM] 爪乇Єƚ: The current web page context is about ASP.NET web validation controls. Here are some key points:

- **Validation controls** are used to check the user input data and provide feedback on errors.
- **Client-side validations** are convenient and fast, but can be bypassed by malicious users or incompatible browsers.
- **Server-side validations** are secure and reliable, but require a postback to the server.
- **BaseValidator class** is the parent class of all validation controls. It has common properties such as ControlToValidate, EnableClientScript, Text, ErrorMessage, IsValid, etc.
- **RequiredFieldValidator** ensures that an input control is not empty.
- **RangeValidator** checks that an input value falls within a specified range.
- **CompareValidator** compares the value of one input control to another input control or a fixed value.
- **RegularExpressionValidator** matches the value of an input control to a specified pattern.
- **CustomValidator** allows custom validation logic using server-side or client-side code.
- **ValidationSummary** displays a summary of all validation errors on a web page.
- **CausesValidation** property determines whether a button control triggers the validation process or not.
- **ValidationGroup** property groups validation controls that belong to the same category.
[11/9, 11:18 PM] 爪乇Єƚ: The **RequiredFieldValidator** and **CustomValidator** are both validation controls in ASP.NET, but they serve different purposes:

- **RequiredFieldValidator**: This control is used to make an input field required. It ensures that the user cannot skip the input or leave it empty. If the user tries to submit the form without entering any data in the required field, the RequiredFieldValidator will display an error message.

- **CustomValidator**: This control allows you to write your own custom validation logic. You can use either client-side script or server-side code to perform the validation. This is useful when the standard validation controls do not meet your needs and you need more complex validation rules.

In summary, use RequiredFieldValidator when you simply need to make sure an input field is not left empty, and use CustomValidator when you need to implement more complex validation rules.
[11/9, 11:18 PM] 爪乇Єƚ: Entity Framework is an open-source Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework for .NET applications supported by Microsoft¹². It enables developers to work with data using objects of domain-specific classes without focusing on the underlying database tables and columns where this data is stored¹². 

With Entity Framework, developers can work at a higher level of abstraction when they deal with data, and can create and maintain data-oriented applications with less code compared with traditional applications¹. It eliminates the need for most of the data-access code that developers usually need to write¹.

Entity Framework fits between the business entities (domain classes) and the database. It saves data stored in the properties of business entities and also retrieves data from the database and converts it to business entities objects automatically¹.

Some of the features of Entity Framework include:
- **Cross-platform**: EF Core is a cross-platform framework which can run on Windows, Linux and Mac¹.
- **Modelling**: EF creates an EDM (Entity Data Model) based on POCO (Plain Old CLR Object) entities with get/set properties of different data types¹.
- **Querying**: EF allows us to use LINQ queries (C#/VB.NET) to retrieve data from the underlying database¹.
- **Change Tracking**: EF keeps track of changes occurred to instances of your entities (Property values) which need to be submitted to the database¹.
- **Saving**: EF executes INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE commands to the database based on the changes occurred to your entities when you call the SaveChanges () method¹.
- **Concurrency**: EF uses Optimistic Concurrency by default to protect overwriting changes made by another user since data was fetched from the database¹.
- **Transactions**: EF performs automatic transaction management while querying or saving data¹.

[11/9, 11:18 PM] 爪乇Єƚ: The current web page context is a lecture note for a course on Web Application Development using .NET technologies. The key points are:

- The course objective is to teach students how to build data-driven web applications using C# language, .NET framework, .NET core, and Entity Framework.
- The course topics include web development with .NET technologies, C# language, .NET framework and .NET core architecture, MVC web applications, Entity Framework and Entity Framework Core, and web application life cycle.
- The course structure consists of lectures, lab sessions, no sessional exam, an external exam, and two projects.
- The first lecture introduces the .NET framework, which is a cluster of technologies that support various types of applications, such as web, windows, mobile, etc.
- The .NET framework consists of several components, such as the Common Language Runtime (CLR), the Base Class Library (BCL), the Data Access Layer (ADO.NET and XML), the ASP.NET and Windows Forms, and the Common Language Specification (CLS) and Common Type System (CTS).
- The CLR is the layer between the operating system and the application written in any .NET language. It provides services such as code management, memory management, security, exception handling, etc. It also converts the Intermediate Language (IL) code into native machine code using the Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler.
- The BCL is a collection of prefabricated functionality for common tasks, such as string handling, file operations, graphics, etc. It helps to ensure consistency and interoperability among different .NET languages.
- The Data Access Layer provides tools for handling database connection and maintenance with front-end .NET technology. It uses XML as a universal language for internet message passing and ADO.NET for data manipulation and querying.
- The ASP.NET and Windows Forms are subsets of .NET technologies that are used to build web and windows applications, respectively. They provide features such as web forms, web services, mobile internet toolkit, etc.
- The CLS and CTS are specifications that define the rules and types that are supported by the .NET framework. They enable cross-language interoperability and type safety among different .NET languages.
[11/9, 11:18 PM] 爪乇Єƚ: The current web page context is about:

- **ASP.NET Web**: A web development framework that uses namespaces, classes, and methods to create web applications¹[1].
- **Stateless server**: A server that does not store any information about previous requests from the client. It requires additional methods to track user progress, such as cookies, sessions, hidden variables, or query strings.
- **Postback and roundtrip**: Terms that describe the process of sending and receiving data between the client and the server. A postback is when the client submits a web form to the server. A roundtrip is when the server processes the form and returns the result to the client.
- **AutoPostBack**: A property that enables a web control to trigger a postback automatically when an event occurs, such as a change in selection. It uses a JavaScript function called __doPostBack() to set the hidden variables and submit the form.

[11/9, 11:18 PM] 爪乇Єƚ: Here are some key points from the current web page context:

- The web page is about **assembly in C# program execution**, which is a way of organizing and deploying .NET applications.
- An **assembly** is a physical collection of classes that contains **intermediate language (IL)** code, **metadata**, and a **manifest**. It can be a **DLL** or an **EXE** file.
- An assembly can be **strongly named** or **weakly named**, depending on whether it is signed with a **public/private key pair** that uniquely identifies the publisher. Strongly named assemblies can be deployed in the **global assembly cache (GAC)** and are **tamper-resistant** and **versioned**.
- An assembly can be **single-file** or **multi-file**, depending on whether it contains all its files in one PE file or splits them into separate modules or resources. Multi-file assemblies can be created using the **assembly linker utility (al.exe)** or the **/addmodule** switch of the C# compiler.
- An assembly can have a **culture** as part of its identity, which indicates the language and region it supports. A **satellite assembly** is a resource-only assembly that contains culture-specific resources for localization purposes.
- An assembly can have a **configuration file** that allows the user or the administrator to control some aspects of the application's execution, such as the location of the assembly's files or the version of the referenced assembly.

[11/9, 11:18 PM] 爪乇Єƚ: The current web page context is about:

- **Entity Framework**: A framework by Microsoft that allows developers to work with relational data as domain objects, eliminating the need for most of the data access code.
- **ORM**: A tool that maps domain objects to relational database objects, such as tables and views, in an automated way, without much programming¹[1].
- **Approaches in EF**: There are three ways to use Entity Framework: Database First, Code First, and Model First. Each approach has its own advantages and disadvantages.
- **Architecture of EF**: Entity Framework consists of several components, such as Conceptual Model, Storage Model, Mapping, LINQ to Entities, Entity SQL, Object Service, and Entity Client Data Provider. These components work together to enable data access and manipulation.
- **Example**: The web page context provides an example of using Database First approach to create a simple student table and perform CRUD operations using Entity Framework. The example shows the code for creating the context class, the insert page, the update page, and the delete page.

[11/9, 11:18 PM] 爪乇Єƚ: The **DataReader** and **DataSet** are both important components of ADO.NET, but they serve different purposes and have different characteristics:

- **DataReader**: 
  - It provides a **forward-only, read-only** cursor for data in a database.
  - It is used for **direct access** to a data source.
  - It is **connected** while reading data, meaning it requires an open connection to the data source.
  - It is **faster** and **more efficient** for situations where you only need to read and display data, not update it.

- **DataSet**: 
  - It is an **in-memory representation** of data that can consist of multiple tables, relations, and constraints.
  - It is used for **disconnected access** to a data source.
  - It can be **disconnected** while working with data, meaning it can work without an open connection to the data source.
  - It is more **flexible** and **powerful** for situations where you need to manipulate, bind, or navigate through your data.

In summary, use a DataReader when you need a fast, forward-only cursor for reading data. Use a DataSet when you need more flexibility or when you need to work with data in a disconnected manner.
[11/9, 11:18 PM] 爪乇Єƚ: The current web page context is about:

- **.NET Core**: A cross-platform, open-source, high-performance software development framework for building modern applications.
- **Benefits and features**: .NET Core has many advantages, such as being cross-platform, unified, modular, testable, and supporting dependency injection and command line tools.
- **.NET Core vs .NET Framework**: .NET Core and .NET Framework are two implementations of .NET for building server-side apps¹[1]²[2]. They have different use cases and compatibility issues.
- **SDK and Runtime**: SDK stands for Software Development Kit, which includes tools and libraries for developing .NET Core applications. Runtime is the environment where .NET Core applications run.
- **CoreCLR**: CoreCLR is the runtime engine of .NET Core, which executes the code and provides services such as memory management, exception handling, and garbage collection.

[11/9, 11:18 PM] 爪乇Єƚ: Here are some key points from the current web page context:

- **ADO.NET**: A technology that allows .NET programs to access and modify data stored in relational databases¹[1].
- **Direct and disconnected access**: Two ways of working with data using ADO.NET. Direct access uses Connection, Command, and DataReader objects to query and update data²[2]. Disconnected access uses DataSet, DataTable, and DataAdapter objects to store and manipulate data in memory.
- **Connection object**: An object that establishes a connection to a specific data source using a connection string.
- **Command object**: An object that executes SQL statements or stored procedures on a data source. It can use ExecuteReader, ExecuteNonQuery, or ExecuteScalar methods depending on the type of query.
- **DataReader object**: An object that provides fast-forward-only, read-only access to the results of a query³[3]. It is used with direct access model.
- **DataSet object**: An object that represents an in-memory cache of data. It can contain multiple tables, relations, and constraints. It is used with disconnected access model.
- **DataAdapter object**: An object that acts as a bridge between a DataSet and a data source. It can fill a DataSet with data from a data source, and update the data source with changes made to the DataSet.

- **DotNetCore MVC**: The document explains how to use the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** design pattern in **ASP.NET Core** applications.
- **Model**: The model contains the classes that represent and manage the data and business logic of the application¹[1]²[2]. The model can use **ViewModels** to contain the data for specific views.
- **View**: The view contains the HTML and Razor markup to display the model data provided by the controller. The view can use **Tag Helpers** to enhance the HTML elements and **Layout Views** to maintain a consistent look and feel across the application.
- **Controller**: The controller handles the user interaction, works with the model, and selects a view to render³[3]. The controller can use **Routing** to map the URLs of incoming requests to actions and **Model Binding** and **Model Validation** to handle the request data and errors.
- **Dependency Injection**: The document also shows how to use **Dependency Injection** to register and inject services into the controllers and views. The document explains the difference between **AddSingleton**, **AddTransient**, and **AddScoped** methods for service registration.
